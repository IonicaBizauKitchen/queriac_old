Queriac
=======

Queriac is a free online tool that allows you to manage your quicksearches, shortcuts, and bookmarklets by taking them out of your browser profile and onto the web, making them portable, taggable, shareable, and generally easier to manage. Drawing from the concept of [http://yubnub.org YubNub] and extending it in the spirit of [http://del.icio.us del.icio.us], Queriac effectively turns your browserâ€™s address bar into a flexible command line.

To start using Queriac head over to http://queri.ac and create an account. It's free and easy.

Here's a screenshot of a command list..
